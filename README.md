# Signals and Systems
This repository contains a set of code-based solutions developed for the homework assignments in ECEN304: Signals and Systems.
This course covered: Mathematical modeling of physical systems and signals. Representation of signals in terms of basis functions. Fourier series expansions, 
Fourier Transforms, Laplace and z-Transforms. Input-output relations, convolution. Transfer functions. System Stability. Poles/zeros and s- and 
z-plane methods. Applications.
